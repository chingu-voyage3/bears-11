#Chingu Voyage 3: Bears-11 Project

##Random Project Generator

This app was created to help teams get to coding faster.  Instead of wasting time trying to think of a project to work
on this app will randomly return a project idea.

Choose a skill level tier.  Chingu tiers correlate with the Free Code Camp curriculum and range from basic HTML/CSS and Javascript to advanced full stack development.
Also choose the type of project you would like to work on: a clone of another app/website; a project that a non-profit
organization has submitted; or a GitHub issue for an existing project

This app is also useful for honing your coding skills.  Get a project to work on daily, weekly, or monthly to practice coding and improve the quality of the work you produce.  The more projects you work on the better you get!

Help future teams/coders out by submitting project ideas you have.
