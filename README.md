Hey Guys,

I made this today from scratch.

All the front-end is in the src folder and its all broken down into components. The main place to look is ProjectBox and its subcomponents.

Additionally, I added some backend in the models folder.

What I did not do was add user authentication. I figure we have a couple places to go from here depending on how we want to do things:

Let anyone submit project ideas.
Require a code to access the ideas submission screen. This avoids user authentication altogether, but still restricts access.
Actually create user authentication with a profile dashboard, user authority, etc -- Which is totally possible, we would just have to put the work in.
